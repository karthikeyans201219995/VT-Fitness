# Member Login Credentials

## How Member Accounts Are Created

When you add a new member through the "Add Member" form, the system automatically creates a login account for that member.

### Password Setup

**Option 1: Set a Custom Password**
- In the "Add Member" form, there's a "Password (for member login)" field
- Enter a password that the member will use to log in
- Share this password with the member securely

**Option 2: Auto-Generated Password**
- Leave the password field empty
- The system will automatically generate a secure random password
- **Note:** Currently, the auto-generated password is not displayed or sent to the member
- **Recommendation:** Always set a custom password when creating members

### Member Login Process

1. Members can log in at the login page using:
   - **Email:** The email address you entered when creating their account
   - **Password:** The password you set (or the auto-generated one)

2. Members will have access to:
   - Their profile information
   - Their attendance records
   - Their payment history
   - Their membership plan details

### Important Notes

- **Email is the username:** Members use their email address to log in
- **Password is set once:** When creating the member account
- **Password reset:** Members can use the "Forgot Password" feature if they forget their password
- **Security:** Always use strong passwords and share them securely with members

### For Gym Administrators

When adding a new member:
1. Fill in all required member information
2. **Set a password** in the password field
3. Write down or securely note the password
4. Share the login credentials with the member:
   - Email: [member's email]
   - Password: [the password you set]
5. Advise the member to change their password after first login

### Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
- Display auto-generated passwords to admin after member creation
- Send welcome email with login credentials to new members
- Require password change on first login
- Password strength indicator in the form
